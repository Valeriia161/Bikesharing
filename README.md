# `Bikesharing Challenge`


 ## `Project Overview ` <br/>
The purpose of Bikesharing Challenge is  to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.
For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I created a set of visualizations to: <br/>
•	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. <br/>
•	Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. <br/>
•	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. <br/>
Finally, I added these new visualizations to the two I created in this module for my final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors. <br/>
#### Resources <br/>
•	Data Source: [Google]( Google) . <br/> 
•	Software: Tableau, Jupyter, Git Bash, GitHub. <br/>

# `Results`


1.	Using Python and Pandas functions, I converted the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00).

After I converted the "tripduration" column to a datetime datatype, I exported the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

2.	In the Deliverable 2 using Tableau, I  created visualizations that show: <br/>
•	How long bikes are checked out for all riders.

•	How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week for all riders.

•	A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender. <br/>

3. In the Deliverable 3  I used two visualizations that I created in this module  -  top starting locations and  top ending locations. <br/>
• The first visualization shows where customers are beginning their bike rental journeys.

• And the second shows where they are dropping off the bikes.
